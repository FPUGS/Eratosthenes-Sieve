# The Sieve of Eratosthenes
A solution to [FPUGS/Eratosthenes-Sieve](https://github.com/FPUGS/Eratosthenes-Sieve)
in Erlang.

I decided to teach myself Erlang... I've got to say: not my favorite functional
language. The concurrency features are pretty awesome, of course, but... it
shows its age.

## Run the Things!
1. [Install Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)
2. Make!

  ```bash
  make
  ```
3. Run!

  ```bash
  make run
  ```
